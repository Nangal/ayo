# Ayo.js Project Governance

The Ayo.js project is governed by its Members, including a Technical Committee (TC) which is responsible for high-level technical guidance of the
project, a Community Committee (CC) which handles non-technical matters, and a group of Elected Final Arbiters (EFA) which have the responsibility of having the final words on issues where it is required.

## Members

The [ayo](https://github.com/ayo) GitHub organization is
maintained by Members who are added by the TC and CC on an ongoing basis.

Individuals identified by the TC as making significant and valuable
contributions of any kind across any Ayo.js repository may be made Members and given
commit access to the project. Activities taken into consideration include (but
are not limited to) the quality of:

* code commits and pull requests
* documentation commits and pull requests
* comments on issues and pull requests
* contributions to the Ayo.js website
* assistance provided to end users and novice contributors
* participation in Working Groups
* other participation in the wider Ayo.js community

If individuals making valuable contributions do not believe they have been
considered for commit access, they may log an issue or contact a TC or CC member
directly.

Modifications of the contents of the ayojs/ayo repository are made on
a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a
modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project
Members. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a
Member with sufficient expertise who is able to take full
responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed
by an existing Member, an additional Member is required
for sign-off.

If one or more Members oppose a proposed change, then the change can not
be accepted unless:

* Discussions and/or additional changes result in no Members objecting to
  the change. Previously-objecting Members do not necessarily have to
  sign-off on the change, but they should not be opposed to it.
* The change is escalated to the TC and the TC votes to approve the change.
  This should only happen if disagreements between Members cannot be
  resolved through discussion.

Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial modifications to
the TC by assigning the `tc-review` label to a pull request or issue. The
TC should serve as the final arbiter where required.

### Member Activities

Typical activities of a Member include:

* helping users and novice contributors
* contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project
* reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests
* participation in adjacent projects
* merging pull requests

The TC periodically reviews the Member list to identify inactive
Collaborators. Past Members are typically given _Emeritus_ status. Emeriti
may request that the TC restore them to active status.

## Technical Committee

The Technical Committee (TC) has final authority over technical issues regarding
this project, including:

* Technical direction
* Project governance
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators

## Community Committee

The Community Committee (CC) is responsible for handling issues regarding the broad
community of the Ayo.js project. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Evangelism (this includes outward appearance, social media, etc)
* Conferences
* Meetups
* Conduct
* Moderation

### Correspondence between TC and CC

The TC and the CC are normally completely independent from each other, however in the
event where an issue arises that crosses both of their areas of expertise, a joint
action is required. In these events, none of the two groups may make a final decision
until the other agrees.

## Elected Final Arbiters

Elected Final Arbiters (EFA) are Members of the Ayo.js projects that serve to resolve issues
where there is no consensus. They are elected on a 1-year term, during which they can choose
to resign at any time. In the event that this happens, reelections immediately taken into
consideration.

There should always be multiple EFAs, a recommended number is 4.

EFAs have the intellectual authority to overrule the TC and the CC on issues where no consensus
can be reached by the group in question or by both. They do not place above the two groups in the hierarchy.

## Consensus Seeking Process

The TC and the CC follow a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model.
