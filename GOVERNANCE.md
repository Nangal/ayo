# Ayo.js Project Governance

The Ayo.js governance is split into multiple parts:

* The project Members
* The core team, which is responsible for the high-level decisions
* The moderation team, which enforces the Code of Conduct
* Multiple sub-teams, which handle more specific matters
* occasionally, EFA's (Elected Final Arbiters), which serve to break stalemates in consensus finding

## Members

The [ayo](https://github.com/ayojs) GitHub organization is
maintained by Members who are added on an ongoing basis.

Individuals identified as making significant and valuable
contributions of any kind across any Ayo.js repository may be made Members and
given commit access to the relevant project, as well as invited into the
GitHub organization. Activities taken into consideration include
(but are not limited to) the quality of:

* code commits and pull requests
* documentation commits and pull requests
* comments on issues and pull requests
* contributions to the Ayo.js website
* assistance provided to end users and novice contributors
* participation in Working Groups
* other participation in the wider Ayo.js community

If individuals making valuable contributions do not believe they have been
considered for commit access, they may log an issue or contact a committee
directly.

Modifications of the contents of the ayojs/ayo repository are made on
a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a
modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project
Members. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a
Member with sufficient expertise who is able to take full
responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed
by an existing Member, an additional Member is required
for sign-off.

If one or more Members oppose a proposed change, then the change can not
be accepted unless:

* Discussions and/or additional changes result in no Members objecting to
  the change. Previously-objecting Members do not necessarily have to
  sign-off on the change, but they should not be opposed to it.
* The change is escalated to the Technical Committee and the Technical
  Committee votes to approve the change.
  This should only happen if disagreements between Members cannot be
  resolved through discussion.

### Member Activities

Typical activities of a Member include:

* helping users and novice contributors
* contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project
* reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests
* participation in other Ayo.js-related projects
* merging pull requests

Past Members are typically given _Emeritus_ status. Emeriti
may request that they be restored to active status.

## Teams

Teams exist in order to steward certain parts of the project.

All team members are elected by method of volunteering. Any Member can volunteer for teams, or be nominated by a team member. All nominations are publicly reviewed and voted on by the existing team members.

If a team member decides to step down, they can do so instantly. If a team member is found to be violating the project's Code of Conduct, they will be moderated and potentially permanently ejected from the team.

There should always be at least 3 members of any team.

There are a number of fixed teams:

#### Core team

The core team is a team with the purpose of deciding the general direction of the project and managing cross-cutting concerns. They only decide over the most high-level aspects, all other matters should be delegated to another, more specific team.

#### Moderation team

The moderation team serves to enforce the project's Code of Conduct and manage situations of conflict. There are no core team members on the moderation team, in order to not pick sides.

#### Sub-teams

Other teams focus on one particular area of the project. They have full autonomy over said area, their decisions do not need to be approved by any core team member. Every sub-team needs to have one member that is also a member of the core team, in order to notice and manage cross-cutting concerns.

## Elected Final Arbiters

Elected Final Arbiters (EFA) are Members of the Ayo.js project that serve to
resolve issues where there is no consensus. They are elected on a per-issue
basis.

There should always be multiple EFAs, a recommended number is 3-5.

EFAs have the authority to establish a decisive vote on issues where no
consensus can be reached by the team(s). They do not place
above the teams in the hierarchy, for they are Members. A EFA should not be
a member of the core team, such as not to take sides.

## Consensus Seeking Process

The teams and EFAs follow a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model.
